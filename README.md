# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ziemann

I'm currently working on [zkpoex](https://github.com/ziemen4/zkpoex), actively learning about ZK and when possible contributing to [Ultrasound Labs](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs), passionate about the future of **crypto** and **blockchain** technologies. 
I have several interests including **applied mathematics**, **cryptography**, **AI**, and **neuroscience**.

### ðŸ›  What I Do
- **Blockchain R&D**: Currently exploring the latest in the Ethereum roadmap and trying to improve myself constantly.
- **Cryptography**: Currently on [Thaler's study group](https://discord.com/channels/740913612368904192/902875064452677672) learning everything ZK related

### ðŸŒ± Current Focus
I'm currently focused on pushing the boundaries on **ZK Bridges** with **Untron** at **Ultrasound Labs**.

### ðŸ“š Notebook
I'm also working on my personal blog/notebook, which you can check [here](https://ziemen4.github.io/z-notes/), where I'll be sharing insights on whatever I learn or think is interesting to share :)
